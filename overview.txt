compile.bat and run.bat are both located in the 'src' folder.

compile.bat compiles the program as class files to the 'classes' folder.
 
After compiling, run run.bat to launch the program. 

Commands will display results in both the GUI and the command prompt - the 'help'
command will be more legible in the command prompt because its output has line breaks.
